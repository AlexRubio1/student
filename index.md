## The best homepage ever
THe start of my journey was a little intense has I didn't know what I was for a little bit until the teacher and my dad helped me. Going on I started to try and use python to code possibly and animation or anything. Starting with this homepage I'm going to try and make it entertaining.

More about myself is that I love playing football and that it's my passion. I wanted to start to learn coding because of my dad and video games. I saw by how the graphics and everything made me intruged and how I can do that to other people too and how I could increase my knowledge.

These are my parents at one paseo, My dad is an engineer which I think is awesome.

He is the main reason that I started this class and as I learn more about how to code I realize how much I can do.
