## Alex Rubio's Homepage
THe start of my journey was a little intense has I didn't know what I was for a little bit until the teacher and my dad helped me. Going on I started to try and use python to code possibly and animation or anything. Starting with this homepage I'm going to try and make it entertaining. 

<script>
from PIL import Image

image_filename = '![Alt text](DSC06914.jpg)'

# Open and resize the image
image = Image.open(image_filename).resize((300, 200))

# Save the new image
image.save("output_image_from_photos.png")

# Display the image (true)
image.show(true)
